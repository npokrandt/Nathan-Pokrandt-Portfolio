# Nathan's Portfolio

## How to use this site

Welcome to my portfolio! Within it are five of my best websites.

At the top of the page is a header with my name, and links to the rest of the page. Beneath that is a banner with my avatar, and a neat subtitle. Below that is an "about me" section, and then the section with all my websites. Click on any of them to visit the website listed on it. Finally, there are contact links at the bottom of the page to my Github, LinkedIN and others.
