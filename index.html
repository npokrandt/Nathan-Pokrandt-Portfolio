<!-- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport -->

                <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Pokrandt! This is my website, where all of my best projects are showcased! I got into coding late in high school, when my mentor, also into computers, noted that I had certain qualities that might make me a good coder, such as problem-solving and logical reasoning. I then graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from Emmaus Bible College in 2020, with a 4.0 GPA. I currently live on the East side of Madison.</p>
                <p>Hobbies of mine include biking all over town, other outdoors fun including hiking, and solving every kind of puzzle in existence, including jigsaws, sudokus, crosswords and many others! I also enjoy playing games, reading, and possibly spending too much time on YouTube.</p>
